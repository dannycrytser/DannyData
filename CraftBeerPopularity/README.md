This dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews) contains a huge amount of information on craft beers taken from the popular 
site BeerAdvocate. I did some exploratory data analysis (popularity, alcohol content, style, number of reviews) and drew a few interesting conclusions.
