Here is an exploratory and explanatory data analysis I carried out on some online marketing data, with an eye toward improving performance. 

* The R script will run as long as you have all required libraries installed (tidyverse, openxlsx, lubridate, and "zoo". 
* I have the data stored in a folder called Data within the main directory. 
* If you don't want to create that folder to hold the .csv files, you can edit the script to change the read_csv commands. 
* There is a substantial amount of output to the terminal, mostly headers and views of various tibbles. These can be commented out. 
* The only thing written by the R script should be a .xlsx file called IXIS_Data_Science.xlsx. 
* This contains two sheets with the selected data.
* I've commented out all the commands generating images at the end, but they can be uncommented.
* The second part is a .ppt and .pdf of the client deliverable slide deck.
